## Overview

All API requests require authentication. You can authenticate using either bearer tokens or API keys depending on your use case.

## Authentication Methods

### Bearer Token Authentication

For most API requests, use bearer token authentication by including your token in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

### API Key Authentication

Alternatively, you can authenticate using API keys by including your key in the request header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

## Getting Your Credentials

### Obtaining a Bearer Token

1. Log in to your dashboard
2. Navigate to the API section
3. Generate a new bearer token
4. Copy and securely store your token

<Warning>
Bearer tokens expire after 24 hours. You'll need to refresh them regularly for long-running applications.
</Warning>

### Obtaining an API Key

1. Go to your account settings
2. Select "API Keys" from the menu
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Name your key and set appropriate permissions
5. Copy and securely store your API key

<Tip>
API keys don't expire but can be revoked at any time from your dashboard.
</Tip>

## Security Best Practices

- **Never expose credentials in client-side code** - Keep your tokens and API keys on your server
- **Use environment variables** - Store credentials as environment variables, not in your codebase
- **Rotate credentials regularly** - Generate new credentials periodically and revoke old ones
- **Use HTTPS only** - Always make requests over HTTPS to protect your credentials in transit
- **Implement proper error handling** - Don't log or expose credentials in error messages

## Authentication Errors

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "unauthorized",
    "message": "Invalid or missing authentication credentials"
  }
}
```

Common authentication issues:
- Missing Authorization header
- Expired bearer token
- Invalid API key
- Insufficient permissions for the requested resource
