description: 'Understand Caspen rate limiting and throttle headers'
---

## Overview

Caspen applies a single throttle: **60 requests per minute for each API key**. The throttle window starts when you make the first request and resets 60 seconds later, at which point the allowance refills to 60 calls.

## Current limit

| Limit type | Requests | Window | Scope |
|------------|----------|--------|-------|
| Standard | 60 | 60 seconds | Per API key |

## Reset behavior

When you send a request, the counter tracks how many calls you have made in the last 60 seconds. Once a call becomes older than 60 seconds, it no longer counts against the quota. There is no separate daily or monthly limit.

## Response headers

Every response includes throttling headers so you can monitor usage:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 1
```

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed in the rolling window (always 60). |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Remaining requests before you hit the limit. |
| `Retry-After` | Seconds to wait before retrying. Only present when you are limited. |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp for when the current window resets. |

## When you exceed the limit

If you send more than 60 requests within 60 seconds, Caspen returns `429 Too Many Requests` with a short error body and backoff headers.

```http
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
Retry-After: 32
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1758868775
Content-Type: application/json

{"message":"Too Many Attempts."}
```

Wait for the number of seconds indicated in `Retry-After` or until the time reported in `X-RateLimit-Reset` before sending the next request.
