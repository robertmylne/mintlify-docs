## Overview

Caspen uses conventional HTTP status codes to describe request outcomes:
- Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success.
- Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an issue with the request.
- Codes in the `5xx` range indicate a server-side problem.

HTTP status codes communicate the category of the problem, and the JSON body provides the platform-formatted message (with field-level errors when validation fails).

## HTTP status codes

### 2xx - Success
| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `200` | OK | The request succeeded |
| `201` | Created | A new resource was created |
| `204` | No Content | The operation succeeded and returns no body |

### 4xx - Client errors
| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `400` | Bad Request | The request cannot be processed (generic client error) |
| `401` | Unauthorized | Missing or invalid bearer token |
| `403` | Forbidden | Authenticated but not allowed to perform this action |
| `404` | Not Found | The requested resource does not exist |
| `409` | Conflict | The request conflicts with the current resource state |
