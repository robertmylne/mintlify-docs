## Overview

The API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general:
- Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success
- Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error with the request
- Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with our servers

## Error Response Format

All errors return a consistent JSON structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "details": {
      "field": "Additional context about the error"
    }
  }
}
```

## HTTP Status Codes

### 2xx - Success
| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `200` | OK | The request was successful |
| `201` | Created | The resource was successfully created |
| `204` | No Content | The request was successful with no response body |

### 4xx - Client Errors
| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `400` | Bad Request | The request was invalid or cannot be served |
| `401` | Unauthorized | Authentication credentials are missing or invalid |
| `403` | Forbidden | The request is valid but not allowed for this user |
| `404` | Not Found | The requested resource could not be found |
| `409` | Conflict | The request conflicts with the current state |
| `422` | Unprocessable Entity | The request was well-formed but contains semantic errors |
| `429` | Too Many Requests | You have exceeded the rate limit |

### 5xx - Server Errors
| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `500` | Internal Server Error | An unexpected error occurred on our servers |
| `502` | Bad Gateway | Invalid response from an upstream server |
| `503` | Service Unavailable | The service is temporarily unavailable |

## Common Error Types

### Validation Errors (422)

When your request contains invalid data, you'll receive a detailed validation error:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "validation_error",
    "message": "The request contains invalid data",
    "details": {
      "email": "Email address is required",
      "age": "Age must be a positive integer"
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication Errors (401)

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "unauthorized",
    "message": "Invalid or missing authentication credentials"
  }
}
```

### Rate Limit Errors (429)

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "message": "Too many requests. Please try again later.",
    "details": {
      "retry_after": 60,
      "limit": 1000,
      "window": "1h"
    }
  }
}
```

### Resource Not Found (404)

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "not_found",
    "message": "The requested resource was not found",
    "details": {
      "resource": "user",
      "id": "123"
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling Best Practices

### Retry Logic

For `5xx` errors and `429` rate limit errors, implement exponential backoff:

```javascript
async function makeRequestWithRetry(url, options, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(url, options);

      if (response.ok) {
        return response;
      }

      // Don't retry client errors (4xx), except rate limits
      if (response.status >= 400 && response.status < 500 && response.status !== 429) {
        throw new Error(`Client error: ${response.status}`);
      }

      // Exponential backoff for server errors and rate limits
      if (attempt < maxRetries) {
        const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000; // 1s, 2s, 4s
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
      }
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### Graceful Degradation

Always handle errors gracefully in your application:

```javascript
try {
  const response = await api.getUser(userId);
  displayUser(response.data);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.status === 404) {
    showMessage("User not found");
  } else if (error.status >= 500) {
    showMessage("Service temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.");
  } else {
    showMessage("An error occurred. Please contact support.");
  }
}
```

## Getting Help

If you encounter persistent `5xx` errors or believe you've found a bug:

1. Check our [status page](https://status.example.com) for known issues
2. Review your request format against this documentation
3. Contact support with the full error response and request details

<Note>
Include the `X-Request-ID` header value from error responses when contacting support for faster troubleshooting.
